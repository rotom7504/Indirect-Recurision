<b><ins>What is Recursion? </b></ins><br>
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.<br>
<br>
<b><ins>Types of Recursions: </b></ins><br>
Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually. The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><ins>Indirect Recursion: </b></ins>In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.<br>
